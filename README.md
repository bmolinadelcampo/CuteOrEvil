# cute or evil?

There are two types of people in the world: 

1. Those who think that cats are the cutest living creatures in the universe. 
2. Those who think that cats are more evil than Satan himself.

After having this discussion infinite times I came up with the idea of creating an app that provides irrefutable proof about what the true nature of cats is. 

## How it works

The app shows 9 images of random cats in random situations. 

It is up to the user to determine wether the cat is cute or evil: Swipe left if the cat is cute. Swipe right if the cat is evil. 

When all the images have been judged, the data collected is processed by a very complex and innovative statistical algorithm (*). Thanks to this algorithm the app is able to proclaim a verdict and cats are sentenced.

## Why I spend 10 hours of my life doing this

Although I was genuinely driven by the idea of contributing to humankind by giving answer to a never-answered question, I had other reasons to develop this app: 

* I discovered [The Cat API](http://thecatapi.com) and I just couldn't not do something with it. 
* It was a fun way to apply my recently acquired networking skills. I connected the app to the API, parsed a .XML file.
* I learned A LOT about syncronous and asyncronous tasks. 
* It was my first time using CocoaPods (I am happy to have given it a go. I really thought installing CocoaPods was much more complicated!).
* I was afraid of forgetting how to write Objective-C while learning Swift.
* I feel so excited about the idea of being able to actually develop an app that I came up with (no matter how silly/simple/crazy/pointless) that I just couldn't let it go!

(*) Ok, if you really wanna know... The app checks if there were more cute or evil cats. Genius, right?
