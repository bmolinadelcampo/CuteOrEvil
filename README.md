# cute or evil? 

There are two types of persons in the world: 

1. Those who think that cats are the cutest living creatures in the universe. 
2. Those who think that cats more are evil than Satan himself.

After having this discussion infinite times I came up with the idea of creating an app that provides irrefutable proof about what the true nature of cats is. 

# How it works

The app shows 9 images of random cats in random situations. 

It is up to the user to determine wether the cat is cute or evil. 

After judging all the images, a verdict is proclaimed and cats are sentenced.
